1. Assume "eyk" is equal to "the"
2. Next try to solve for "L", which is most commonly occuring letter in chipertext. Assume "L" is equal to "a". This was false because a "aa" sequence showed up in the text, which is pretty much impossible in the english language.
3. Next assume "L" is "o". This seemed to work well. No issues.
4. Next assume "M" is "a", since its frequently occuring letter. No issues.
5. Since "MIX" is commonly occuring. Assume its "and"
5. Assume "TT" is "ss". Some issues with words that don't make sense.
6. Assume "O" is "r" to make the word "heard".
7. Assume "F" is "i" becuase it is a high frequency letter.
8. Assume "D" is "c" to form word 'child'
9. Assume "H" is 'y' to form word 'only'
10. Assume text starts with "frodo only a child".
